The task is to create a completely front-end side calculator, based on the following aspects:

1. Any front-end technology can be used, but Angular is preferred.
1. The calculator shall be able to add any number of whole numbers with buttons.
1. The entered digits and operators shall be displayed, after pressing the equals button, the result shall be displayed as well.
1. It is important that data entry cannot be started with an operator, however, negative numners shall be allowed.
1. Multiple operators shall not be allowed in succession, always the last operator shall be effective.
